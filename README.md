Final Project
Program opens a graphical user interface in which a player will play the Rescue the Queens game.

The goal of this game is to find and save all of the Queens hidden on an N x N game board of
cells (or squares) before all of the empty cells on the board are revealed. During the game play,
the player will click on board cells one at a time. If the cell is empty, that cell will be revealed
and all empty cells around the square will also be revealed. If the player clicks on a cell
containing a Queen, the player has successfully rescued a Queen, and the Queen will be
displayed in the cell for the duration of the game, plus the score is updated at the top. The game ends
when either all of the Queens are rescued and the player wins, or all of the empty cells are
revealed causing the player to lose.
